# Course Dependency Resolution

* We define a CourseScheduler class to manage course prerequisites and resolve dependencies.
* The add_prerequisite method is used to add prerequisites for each course.
* The topological_sort method performs a topological sort of the dependency graph.
* The resolve_dependencies method resolves dependencies by considering parallel enrollment and handling circular dependencies.
* Finally, we demonstrate the usage of the CourseScheduler class with an example set of course prerequisites.

# Personalised Learning Path Generation 

To create an algorithm for personalized learning path generation, we can follow these steps:

Data Collection: Gather relevant data about users' interests, past course engagements, performance data, and any other relevant information.

* **User Profiling**: Build user profiles based on the collected data. This may involve clustering users with similar interests or past engagements together.

* **Content Analysis**: Analyze the available learning content to identify prerequisites, dependencies, and relationships between different topics or courses.

* **Recommendation Engine**: Develop a recommendation engine that takes into account user profiles and content analysis to suggest personalized learning paths. This engine should consider factors such as:

## User's interests and preferences
User's past engagement and performance data
Prerequisites for different topics or courses
Difficulty levels of courses
Diversity in content to provide a well-rounded learning experience
Adaptability: Ensure that the algorithm is adaptable to evolving learning goals by regularly updating user profiles based on their interactions with the platform and incorporating feedback mechanisms for users to express their changing interests or goals.

* **Privacy Considerations**: Implement robust privacy measures to protect user data. This may involve:

Anonymizing user data wherever possible
Obtaining explicit consent from users for data usage
Encrypting sensitive information
Complying with relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR or CCPA

* **Evaluation and Improvement**: Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the personalized learning paths generated by the algorithm. Collect feedback from users and monitor their learning progress to identify areas for improvement. Use this feedback to refine the recommendation engine and make it more accurate and effective over time.
